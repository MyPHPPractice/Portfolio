		My decision to enter the field of web development came after having spent the greater part of my 20â€™s in partnership with my brother. Together, we built an organic farm and a local food movement in our NJ hometown.  After five years of non-stop work the business relationship soured and we decided to part ways.  Having built the farm's website on Wordpress I knew web development would satisfy my need to tinker, problem solve, and create.  Since then I have immersed myself in the development world with the same intensity, passion, and excitement as with sustainable agriculture.
